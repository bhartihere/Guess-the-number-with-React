# Guess-the-number-with-React
We developed the "Guess the Number" game, where the player had unlimited chances to guess a random number between 1 and 20. If the guess was incorrect, they were told whether it was higher or lower until they guessed correctly. We created two components: App, which handled logic, and Result, which displayed messages.
